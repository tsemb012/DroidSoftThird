             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

         <h3>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</h3>
         <p>
           You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
           provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
           the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
           Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
           Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License
           permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the
           terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger
           Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under
           the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
         </p>
         <h3>3.4. Notices</h3>
         <p>
           You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
           (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
           limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
           Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
           extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
         </p>
         <h3>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</h3>
         <p>
           You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
           indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
           Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
           behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
           warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
           alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
           liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
           indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
           disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
           jurisdiction.
         </p>
         <h2>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</h2>
         <p>
           If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
           License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
           statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the
           terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
           limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
           text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
           this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
           such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
           skill to be able to understand it.
         </p>
         <h2>5. Termination</h2>
         <p>
           5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if
           You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
           compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
           Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
           Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
           ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
           non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
           come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
           Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
           notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
           first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
           from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
           Your receipt of the notice.
         </p>
         <p>
           5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
           infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
           counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
           directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
           You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1
           of this License shall terminate.
         </p>
         <p>
           5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
           user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
           been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
           to termination shall survive termination.
         </p>
         <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
         <p>
           <em>
             Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis,
             without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
             including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
             free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
             non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
             Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
             defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of
             any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
             warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any
             Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
             disclaimer.
           </em>
         </p>
         <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
         <p>
           <em>
             Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
             (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
             or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable
             to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
             damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost
             profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
             malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if
             such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages.
             This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
             personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent
             applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
             allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
             damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
           </em>
         </p>
         <h2>8. Litigation</h2>
         <p>
           Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
           of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
           business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
           jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
           in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or
           counter-claims.
         </p>
         <h2>9. Miscellaneous</h2>
         <p>
           This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
           matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
           unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
           necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
           that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
           shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
         </p>
         <h2>10. Versions of the License</h2>
         <h2>10.1. New Versions</h2>
         <p>
           Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
           10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
           publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
           distinguishing version number.
         </p>
         <h3>10.2. Effect of New Versions</h3>
         <p>
           You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
           the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or
           under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
           steward.
         </p>
         <h3>10.3. Modified Versions</h3>
         <p>
           If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
           create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified
           version of this License if you rename the license and remove any
           references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such
           modified license differs from this License).
         </p>
         <h3>
           10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
           Licenses
         </h3>
         <p>
           If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
           Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
           notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
         </p>
         <h2>Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice</h2>
         <blockquote>

           </p>
         </blockquote>
         <p>
           If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,
           then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a
           relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
           notice.
         </p>
         <p>
           You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
         </p>
         <h2>Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice</h2>
         <blockquote>
           <p>
             This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as
             defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

           and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
         </p>
         <p>
           "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
           the copyright owner that is granting the License.
         </p>
         <p>
           "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
           other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
           control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

           direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
           otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
           outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
         </p>

         </p>
         <p>
           "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

           copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
           (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
         </p>
         <p>
           "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
           form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

           of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
           separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

           the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
           means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

         <p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
           the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
           License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>
     
         <b><a name="section0" id="section0"></a>0. Additional Definitions.</b>
     
         <p>As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
           General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU
           General Public License.</p>
     
         <p>“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License,
           other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>
     
         <p>An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided
           by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
           Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
           of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>
     
         <p>A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
           Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
           with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
           Version”.</p>
     
         <p>The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
           Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
           for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
           based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>
     
         <p>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
           object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
           and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
           Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>
     
         <b><a name="section1" id="section1"></a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</b>
     
         <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
           without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
     
         <b><a name="section2" id="section2"></a>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</b>
     
         <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
           facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
           that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
           facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
           version:</p>
     
         <ul><li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
           ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
           function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
           whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</li>
     
           <li>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
             this License applicable to that copy.</li>
         </ul><b><a name="section3" id="section3"></a>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</b>
     
         <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
           a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
           code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
           material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
           layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
           (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>
     
         <ul><li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
           Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.</li>
     
           <li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
             document.</li>
         </ul><b><a name="section4" id="section4"></a>4. Combined Works.</b>
     
         <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
           taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
           portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
           engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
           the following:</p>
     
         <ul><li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
           the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
           covered by this License.</li>
     
           <li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
             document.</li>
     
           <li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
             execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
             these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
             copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</li>
     
           <li>d) Do one of the following:
     
             <ul><li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
               License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
               suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
               recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
               the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
               manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
               Corresponding Source.</li>
     
               <li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                 Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
                 a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
                 system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
                 of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
                 Version.</li>
     
             </ul></li>
     
           <li>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
             be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
             GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
             necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
             Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
             Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
             you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
             the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
             Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
             Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
             for conveying Corresponding Source.)</li>
         </ul><b><a name="section5" id="section5"></a>5. Combined Libraries.</b>
     
         <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
           Library side by side in a single library together with other library
           facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
           License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
           choice, if you do both of the following:</p>
     
         <ul><li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
           on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
           conveyed under the terms of this License.</li>
     
           <li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
             is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
             accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</li>
     
         </ul><b><a name="section6" id="section6"></a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</b>
     
         <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
           of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
           versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
           differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
     
         <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
           Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
           of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version”

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for

             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,

             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the

             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,

             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,

             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

           <p class="inline">
             Subject to the terms and conditions of
             this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
             worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
             (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
             use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
             where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
             Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
             with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
             cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
             or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
             or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
             granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

             This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement
     
             <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
             1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
             and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
             is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
             forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.
     
             1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
             Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
             http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.
     
             1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
             Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
             website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
             time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).
     
             1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
             1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.
     
     
             <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
             2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
             the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.
     
             2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.
     
             2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
             barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
             including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.
     
             2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
             other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
             employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
             authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
             employer or other entity.
     
     
             <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
             3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
             royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
             solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.
     
             3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
             non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
             to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
             Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.
     
             3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
             the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
             Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
             trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
             expressly granted to you.
     
             3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
             Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
             copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
             disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
     
             3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
             source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
             license and not the License Agreement.
     
             3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
             prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
             applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
             (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
             users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.
     
             3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
             trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
     
             3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
             (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
             SDK.
     
     
             <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
             4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
             under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
             SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.
     
             4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
             (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
             practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
             export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).
     
             4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
             will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
             names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
             users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
             legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
             personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
             provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
             that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
             which, the user has given you permission to do so.
     
             4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
             development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
             accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
             any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.
     
             4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
             display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
             actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
     
             4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
             you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
             any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
             regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
             party may suffer) of any such breach.
     
     
             <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
             5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
             credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
             you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
             credentials.
     
     
             <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
             6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
             statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
             address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
             the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
             collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
             information will not be collected.
     
             6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
             accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.
     
     
             <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
             7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
             content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
             those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
             resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
             responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
             any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
             third party applications, data, content, or resources.
     
             7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
             third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
             the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
             lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
             resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
             do so by the relevant owners.
     
             7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
             resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
             case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
             parties.
     
     
             <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
             8.1 Google Data APIs
     
             8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
             protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
             provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
             API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
             sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
             unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.
     
             8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
             that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
             the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
             Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
                 href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
             as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
             Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
             following URL: <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
             as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
             Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.
     
     
             <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
             9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
             set out below.
     
             9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
             SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
     
             9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
             (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
             (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
             (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
             terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
             or
             (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
             country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
             SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
             commercially viable.
     
             9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
             liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
             over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
             indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
             shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
     
     
             <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
             10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
             THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
             GOOGLE.
     
             10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
             OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
             TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
     
             10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
             EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
             MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
     
     
             <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
             11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
             ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
             INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
             YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
             ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
     
     
             <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
             12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
             harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
             agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
             and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
             fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
             develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
             patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
             their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
             Agreement.
     
     
             <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
             13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
             SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
             available on the website where the SDK is made available.
     
     
             <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
             14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
             governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
             separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
             Google in relation to the SDK.
     
             14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
             is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
             applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
             those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
     
             14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
             provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
             License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
             provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
     
             14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
             the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
             companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
             Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
             person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
     
             14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
             YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
             TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
     
             14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
             either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
             Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
             License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
     
             14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
             shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
             laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
             located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
             from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
             allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
             any jurisdiction.

           editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
           represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

           submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
           or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
           the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
           means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

         <p><strong>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</strong><br />
           Version 2, June 1991</p>
     
         <p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
           51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</p>
     
         <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
           of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
     
         <p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>
     
         <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</p>
     
         <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
     
         <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
     
         <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
     
         <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
     
         <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>
     
         <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
     
         <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
     
         <p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</strong></p>
     
         <p><strong>0</strong>. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
     
         <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
     
         <p><strong>1</strong>. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
     
         <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
     
         <p><strong>2</strong>. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
     
         <blockquote>
           <p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
     
           <p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
     
           <p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
         </blockquote>
     
         <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
     
         <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p>
     
         <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p>
     
         <p><strong>3</strong>. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
     
         <blockquote>
           <p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
     
           <p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
     
           <p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
         </blockquote>
     
         <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>
     
         <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
     
         <p><strong>4</strong>. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
     
         <p><strong>5</strong>. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>
     
         <p><strong>6</strong>. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>
     
         <p><strong>7</strong>. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
     
         <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
     
         <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
     
         <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
     
         <p><strong>8</strong>. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
     
         <p><strong>9</strong>. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
     
         <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
     
         <p><strong>10</strong>. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
     
         <p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>
     
         <p><strong>11</strong>. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
     
         <p><strong>12</strong>. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
     
         <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
         <!-- START OF 'HOW TO APPLY' SECTION -->
     
         <p><strong>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</strong></p>
     
         <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
     
         <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
     
         <blockquote>
           <p>One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br />
             Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
     
           <p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</p>
     
           <p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.</p>
     
           <p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p>
         </blockquote>
     
         <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
     
         <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
     
         <blockquote>
           <p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</p>
         </blockquote>
     
         <p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>
     
         <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
     
         <blockquote>
           <p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.</p>
     
           <p>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989<br />
             Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
         </blockquote>
     
         <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.</p>

           other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
           control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
           "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
           direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
           otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
           outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

           including but not limited to software source code, documentation
           source, and configuration files.

         </p>
         <p>
           "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

           "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
           form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
           editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
           represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
           of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
           separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
           the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         <p>
           "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

           or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
           the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
           means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
           to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
           communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

           Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
           excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
           designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         <h3><em>Statement of Purpose</em></h3>
         <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
           automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
           (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
           and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
           a database (each, a "Work").</p>
         <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
           to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
           creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the
           public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
           infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
           reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
           whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
           commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
           Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
           production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
           gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
           through the use and efforts of others.</p>
         <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
           without any expectation of additional consideration or
           compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
           "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
           Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects
           to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
           under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
           Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
           effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
         <p><strong>1. Copyright and Related Rights.</strong>
           A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
           copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
           Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
           are not limited to, the following:
         </p>
         <ol type="i">
           <li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
             display, communicate, and translate a Work;</li>
           <li> moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
             performer(s);</li>
           <li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
             image or likeness depicted in a Work;</li>
           <li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
             to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a),
             below;</li>
           <li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
             reuse of data in a Work;</li>
           <li>database rights (such as those arising under Directive
             96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
             March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under
             any national implementation thereof, including any amended
             or successor version of such directive); and</li>
           <li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
             throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
             any national implementations thereof.</li>
         </ol>
         <p><strong>2. Waiver.</strong> To the greatest extent
           permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
           Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
           unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
           Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
           and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
           existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
           the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
           maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
           (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
           future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
           purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
           advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
           makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public
           at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
           successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
           subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
           or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
           enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
           Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
         </p>
         <p><strong>3. Public License Fallback.</strong> Should any
           part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
           ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be
           preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
           Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
           extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
           affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
           sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
           license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
           in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
           maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
           (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
           future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
           purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
           advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The
           License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
           applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
           License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
           ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
           ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
           License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
           she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
           Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
           associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
           Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
           of Purpose.</p>
         <p><strong>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</strong></p>
         <ol type="a">
           <li>No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are
             waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise

             without limitation warranties of title, merchantability,
             fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the
             absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present
             or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
             the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.</li>
           <li>Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
             other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
             including without limitation any person's Copyright and
             Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
             responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
             permissions or other rights required for any use of the
             Work.</li>
           <li>Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative
             Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
             obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.</li>
